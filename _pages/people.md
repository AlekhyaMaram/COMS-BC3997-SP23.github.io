# TODO
#
# To add yourself to this page copy the commented out text below
# and replace everything in <> with the requested data then un-comment
# it by removing the "#". Make sure to also place an image of yourself
# in the folder as described by image_path. To test that you did it correct
# run "bundle exec jekyll serve" in the terminal (or however you should
# do it for the OS that you are using) and navigate to the people page
# and make sure it all looks correct. Then submit a PR.
